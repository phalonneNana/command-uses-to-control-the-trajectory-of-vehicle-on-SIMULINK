# command-uses-to-control-the-trajectory-of-vehicle-on-SIMULINK

This project contains different block made on simulink to control the trajectory of vehicle. So if the driver loses control of the vehicle, or if a turn or braking is too sudden, our command will directly take control of the vehicle and thus can limit huge accidents.
